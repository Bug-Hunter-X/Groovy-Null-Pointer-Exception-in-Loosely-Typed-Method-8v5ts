# Groovy Null Handling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Groovy related to null pointer exceptions arising from the language's dynamic typing system.

The `bug.groovy` file contains a method that doesn't explicitly handle null input, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exceptions in certain scenarios.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version demonstrating safer null handling techniques.

## Problem

In Groovy, if you don't explicitly handle null values, operations performed on null objects can result in `NullPointerExceptions`. This is particularly true when dealing with methods that may receive null as input.

## Solution

The best practice is to explicitly check for null values and handle them gracefully (e.g., return a default value, throw an exception, or log an error).  This avoids runtime exceptions and provides more predictable behavior.
